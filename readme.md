# Gaffr

_It's time to move forward, it's time to move in._

As a team we have produced an app called “Gaffr” which allows tenants and landlords to find a match by swiping each other in the style of Tinder. We had daily stand-ups to organise our work, as well as using techniques like mob-programming to have a collective input when learning new technology stacks. To help the team visualise the finished product we created a wireframe PDF using Balsamiq. For the Front End we used React Native and TypeScript to create the application. We utilised Firebase's Authentication, Storage and Firestore features to to build a back-end that provides us with a secure login, in-app image upload, database and live-chat functionality. We used Expo to build and test the whole application. Throughout the project we used pair programming to catch errors and keep each other productive. As a team, we closely followed Github best practises.
